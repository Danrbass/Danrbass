## About Me. 

My name is Daniel, and I am a Brazilian Business Intelligence and Data Analyst. I have been working in these roles since 2018, gaining experience in sectors such as retail, hospitality, consulting, real estate, and funeral services. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Production Engineering and a Technologist degree in Precision Mechanics.

I have extensive expertise in managing projects that span from data extraction to analysis, always considering project requirements and business models to uncover relevant insights and generate innovative ideas. I am proficient in Power BI, Python, SQL, and Excel, and I am also familiar with other programming languages, including JavaScript, C++, HTML5, and CSS3. Additionally, I possess basic knowledge of Google tools such as Google Analytics, Google Looker Studio, Google Tag Manager, and Google Spreadsheets.

I consider myself a creative, communicative, and critical thinker. I strive to fully understand the situation at hand, make informed decisions based on the available data, and introduce new perspectives for exploration.
